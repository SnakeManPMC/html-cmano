<h2>Scenario Design</h2>
<p>Events give life to a scenario, breaking out hostilities, news, intel, weather reports etc.
</p>

<p>Starting different sides as neutral, then breaking of hostilities gives real excitement to a scenario.
</p>

<p>Civilian and biological traffic gives every day life feeling to scenarios, its not all bad guys out there. Everytime you get a contact, you cant be sure its a bad guy to shoot at as it could be civilian Airbus airliner or a whale.
</p>

<p>Scenario completed event must be real nice congratulating text, perhaps even different texts depending how you did (if its possible from editing side of things). Give player the good feeling that his efforts were noticed and appreciated.
</p>

<p>Campaign missions should build up international tension for a war, few if not several peace time missions before all the hell breaks loose.
</p>

<p>PMCTODO this needs to be in scenario editing page: CTRL-X copies the lat/lon of where your cursor is at on the globe.
