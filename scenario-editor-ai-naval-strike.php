	<h2>Scenario Editor AI Naval Strike</h2>

<p>
OPFOR naval strikes aka AI ASuW mission.
</p>

<p>
Same as sub ASuW sea control patrol, just create soviet TU-16 Badger recon mission with radar on, then define strike patrol area for striker TU-22 Backfires which sit and wait in the airbase until enemies (you, the players ships) are detected in the strike patrol area.
</p>

<p>
At least in one scenario shipped with CMANO original game clearly has this kind of setup where as long as my ships avoid being detected by the TU-16 Badger radar aircraft "snooper", there will be no onslaught enemy attack, but if the snooper gets a radar lock on your ships then you can expect hordes of soviet aircrafts barreling down on your position. I assume with a big defined area strike patrol box you could easily setup relaxed OPFOR which attacks you if detected.
