<h2>Scenario Play Throughs</h2>
<p>This is a list of scenarios I played through and very quick comments of how good the scenario was, how I played, my losses and ending score. These are from Community Scenario Pack 30 dated Dec 7th, 2015. But that is just a start, I'm hoping to grow this as I play along any scenarios I get my hands on as well as campaigns.
</p>

<p>Trying not to put any spoilers here, but if you are overly cautious about such things its better not to read this before you have played these scenarios as some of my comments might give away some scenario plots / surprises.
</p>

<p><b>688 Attack Sub #4, Mumar Cadaver, 1989.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 0747hrs to 0821hrs. Use auto and manual fire on tankers, ran out of weapons to fire (heh), ended mission when there was still one target tanker left.
<br><br>
Score 300
</p>

<p><b>688 Attack Sub #8, Surprise Party, 1989.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 0830hrs to 0847hrs. Didn't get any contacts, only one helicopter contact (from periscope?) once.
<br><br>
losses 1x DDG 993 Kidd. Score -100
</p>

<p><b>A Day at Red Flag, 1977.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 0849hrs to 0935hrs. First A2A engagement went fine, but when strike package approached targets things started to go bad. losses 15x F-4E Phantom II. Nellis air force base had no magazine stores for aircrafts to rearm, eh?
<br><br>
Score -75
</p>

<p><b>Air Battle over Berat-Kutov, 2021.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 0935hrs to 1002hrs. First engagement went off before planes could fully takeoff, half of the mirages had like 20min ready time left, nice scenario design dude, haha. Shot all enemy attackers down, mission completed.
<br><br>
losses 1x Mirage 2000-5 Mk2. Triumph, Score 440
</p>

<p><b>Albania Airstrike, 1984.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 1003hrs to 1039hrs. Took out both SA2 sites, then strike once the norther airbase with unknown BDA when mission ended.
<br><br>
losses 4x G.91Y Gina and 1x F-104S Starfighter CBO. Disaster, Score -800
</p>

<p><b>Ancient Armies, Modern Weapons, 2014.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 1405hrs to 1547hrs. Completely crazy if not bizarred briefing and unit selections. F-5's got shot down like flies, they must have encountered F14's on the enemy side (AIM54's), totally odd scenario. I left scenario running, put win7 desktop locked mode and when I came back CMANO had crashed.
<br><br>
Anyways, really weird scenario, avoid this in the future.
</p>

<p><b>Andaman Sea Clash, 2005.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 1554hrs to 2044hrs. Thai fishing boat scenario. Small and limited but quite nice. Strange to say but "exciting" scenario as its so peace time mood with tensions between two border countries.
<br><br>
Took me a while to realize which ships I had to intercept (stupid me), could have saved lot of trouble of figuring it out quicker. Had small surface to surface engagements and air to air, small stuff. On first surface engagement one of my harpoons got away and destroyed 1x Commercial Trawler [800t DWT], hehe.
<br><br>
losses 2x F-5E Tiger II and thai fishing boats: 2x Commercial Fishing Boat [35m], 3x Civilian Junk [35m]. Average, Score 165
</p>

<p><b>Andromeda at the Ready, 1984.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-13-16 2139hrs to 03-14-16 0105hrs. Persian Gulf action, UK vs Iran, pretty nice mood in this one. Iranian F-5's got through and sunk the ship I was escoring, RIP. It was odd scenario that I had very little protection against the F5's.
<br><br>
losses 1x Lynx HAS.3, 1x Wessex HAS.3. Minor Deafeat, Score -65
</p>

<p><b>Angamos Goes the Distance, 1980.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-14-16 0935hrs to 0943hrs. Diesel sub extracting spies scenario. My sub hit a mine and was destroyed at over 600ft depth heh. This scenario would be good default example for those SEAL insertion/extraction sub scenarios (dangerous waters campaign manuscript).
<br><br>
Had another try, picked up the government officers just fine. It was bit scary as sonar heard two explosions when whales/tuna hit mines heh. Scenario ended after I barely got out of the pickup zone?
<br><br>
Minor Victory, Score 100
</p>

<p><b>Annaba Constant, 1960.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-14-16 ?hrs to 1314hrs. Very old 1960 stuff, very small limited scenario.
<br><br>
losses 1x P-2E (P2V-5) Neptune. Minor Victory, Score 370
</p>

<p><b>April Storm - 1 - The New Eastern Front, 1996.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-14-16 1414hrs to 03-15-16 1159hrs. Europe '96 large airwar, fight over poland. Somewhat overwhelming feeling at first glance of all the cities, airbases and aircrafts out there. In my first air to air engagement I lost 4 ship F16's as I didn't shoot first :(
<br><br>
Laggy scenario, its not even that large in my opinion... but very laggy, its not fun to play :(
<br><br>
It was quite painful scenario to do especially with the sluggish performance, so I saved game and took a break after like hour+ of playing. Then at last part of the scenario I setup a mission for fighters to anti-air patrol, this caused bit of losses I noticed.
<br><br>
losses 13x F-16C Blk 30 Falcon, 7x F-15C Eagle, 2x Radar (AN/FPS-117(E)1), 1x EF-111A Raven. Triumph, Score 940
</p>

<p><b>ASW EX - 1971 Spanish Coast, 1971.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-15-16 1203hrs to 1235hrs. Spanish carrier group. At start scenario looked really small; only your carrier and one waypoint heh. Really odd scenario, to accomplish it I didn't do anything except put time accelleration up, heh.
<br><br>
losses 2x D 61 Gearing FRAM 1. Triumph, Score 300
</p>

<p><b>ASW Exercise, 2006.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-15-16 1243hrs to hrs. Enterprise carrier group hunting subs in US east coast. I didn't do anything except setup a existing patrol zone for my ASW aircrafts, then I just sat back and time accellerated it.
<br><br>
No losses. Average, Score 20
</p>

<p><b>Attack on H3, 1981.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-16-16 2128hrs to 2303hrs. Quite interesting looking historical iranian airstrike to iraq H3 airfield, deep penetration strike stuff. Lost one aircraft in first engagement as I had too strict ROE for the group, newbie mistake. My first strike was total failure, no damage to enemy and only losses for my strike package. Somehow two of my tankers in iranian side were shot down, didn't see how it happened (pay attention!).
<br><br>
Very laggy scenario, noticeable especially when trying to click icons and having some time accelleration. Over 1min time accelleration basically froze the scenario, there is some events or something bugging in this scenario for sure(?). Maybe give this a try later with v1.11 or later Command version, or if scenario author fixes it.
<br><br>
Decided the end the mission myself. losses 8x F-5E Tiger II, 5x F-4E Phantom II, 1x Boeing 747-100 Tanker, 2x Boeing 707-3J9C Boom/Drogue Tanker. Average, Score 135
</p>

<p><b>Attack Sub Duel off Hokkaido, 2003.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-17-16 0003hrs to 0028hrs. Jap sub scenario, your only force is a submarine, very small scenario. Didn't do much, just continued on my course and then fired on russian kilo.
<br><br>
Average, Score 55
</p>

<p><b>Baltimore on the Prowl, 1952.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-17-16 0029hrs to 0119hrs. Very small scenario, peace time stuff of coast of lebanon.
<br><br>
Triumph, Score 100
</p>

<p><b>Battle Ocean '64 -- Baltic Convoy, 1964.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-17-16 1113hrs to ?hrs. Peace time weapons hold polish convoy escort situation. My ASW patrol aircrafts went little nuts and steered off course completely, this was most likely due to the no fly zone very close to my patrol zone. Overall enjoyable scenario, except that it ended suddenly.
<br><br>
losses 2x D 170 Z1 [Fletcher]. Major defeat, Score -120
</p>

<p><b>Battle Ocean '64 -- North Sea ASW, 1964.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-17-16 1728hrs to n/a hrs. Scenario is continuing the story from battle ocean 64 baltic convoy. I made a mistake and exited game without saving, didn't want to restart this mission from the beginning.
</p>

<p><b>Battle Ocean '64 -- Teesport Convoy, 1964.scen</b>
<br><br>
03-18-16 0037hrs to 0407hrs. Felt like another small scenario, very few blufor units. Quite long scenario, yet funnily no bloodshed, no casualties for russian side and no losses for me, heh odd.
<br><br>
Triumph, Score 600
