	<h2>Ship Traveling Time</h2>

<p>
CVN 68 Nimitz traveling 15 knots from The United States New York coast to Iceland Keflavik takes from July 5th 1200hrs to July 12th 0138hrs. This is over <b>ONE WEEK</b> of traveling at 15 knots.
</p>

<p>
Just wanted to learn how long it takes to travel that distance (at that speed?), I don't think it would make a very enjoyable mission/scenario if you started from NY ie US east coast, with atlantic ocean full of soviet subs and then you were greeted in the end with fleet of badger/backfire bombers from Iceland. Such scenario needs to be split into several smaller segments to keep it interesting or "manageable".
</p>

<p>
I love long slow brewing missions/scenarios with hours of boredom and seconds of terror, however this kind of time accelerating for in-game days is quite extreme, although if the atlantic is peppered with random soviet commie scum subs then your P3C Orion and other fleet borne anti submarine warware (ASW) aircrafts/helicopters have their hands full so time accelerating a high speed might be problematic.
</p>

<p>
Dunno, maybe New York to Iceland transit would be best to split into maybe 4 smaller more focused missions/scenarios. Depends on the campaign style of course.
