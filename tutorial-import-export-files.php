<h2>Tutorial - Import Export Units / Groups Files</h2>

<p>When you create airbases, groups of ships etc, you can save these units/groups into import/export files. This way you dont need to create that large carrier group with aircrafts every single time you want to create such scenario.
</p>

<p>Select the units you want to export, then choose menu Editor -> Import/Export Units -> Save selected units/groups to file. Then just name the file and save. Please do not use spaces or other special characters in directory or file names (obvious).
</p>

<p>You can browse directories when saving .inst file, however when loading it defaults to the [game-root]\ImportExport\ directory which is real shame. Your files are in huge pile of files made by other people, no customization for your own needs.
</p>

<p>You can however create your own sub directory in [game-root]\ImportExport\ directory so finding your own files is bit easier.
